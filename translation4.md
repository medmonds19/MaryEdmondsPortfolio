**In the two clauses "“DANAI MINERVAE DONUM DANT”, castraque transtulērunt Tenedo.", can you highlight subjects and verbs?**


When the Greeks weren't able to capture Troy for 10 years,
epeus made a wooden horse of amazing magnitude.
In it were gathered Menelaus, Ulixes, Domedes, Thessandwer, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thomas, Machaon, Neoptolemus.
And on the horse they wrote "Minerva of Greece gives a gift," and carried it over to the military base in Tenedo. **Grammatically, what is the function of *castra*?**
When the trojans saw it, they thought that the enemies went away; **What tense is the infinitive *abisse*?**
 Priamus was ordered by Minerva to lead the horse to the temple. Priamus ordered that the Minerva lead the horse to the temple. **Note *Minerva* is a singular (name of a) goddess.  Look at the construction of the indirect statement.**
When the prophet, Cassandra, said that the enemies have the horse, **Possible!  But word order makes it easier to take *equum* as accusative subject of the indirect statement.**
 trust was not given to her and they placed the horse in front of the church.
The Greeks went out of the horse
and the guard fell down and Troy was conquered. **Check the forms of the verbs of these two clauses.**

What case is decem annōs and why?
- decem annos is is accusative because it is a preposational phrase. **Yes, accusative, but there is not preposition with it.**

Explain the sentence structure of DANAI MINERVAE DONUM DANT?
- danai and minervae are both genitive, meaning Minerva of Greece. **These are possible forms, but not the only possible forms of DANAI and MINERVAE.  Try with an explicit subject of (plural) DANT, and then see what case would make sense for MINERVAE.**
- dant is present active, 3rd person plural meaning gives
- donum is accusative singular, direct object of the subject


What type of verb is arbitrati sunt?

What kind of grammatical construction do we have in the sentence Priamus imperavit equum in templum Minervae duci? Identify its constituent parts. **There is a main clause, introducing indirect statement.**

 - the verb is imperavit, it is 3rd person singular, perfect active, Priamus ordered
 - minervae- minervae is dative and the indirect object, the horse to be led by minerva
 - duci is the passive form of the infinitive of the verb to lead (to be led)
 - equum is accusative, direct object of the verb ordered, Priamus ordered the horse
 -in templum is prepositional phrase (to the temple)

Parse duci.
- duci is the passive form of the present infintive of the verb duco, which mans to lead. the translation of duci is "to be led"

What case is ei and what role is it playing in the sentence?
