When the Greeks weren't able to capture Troy for 10 years, 
epeus made a wooden horse of amazing magnitude. 
In it were gathered Menelaus, Ulixes, Domedes, Thessandwer, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thomas, Machaon, Neoptolemus.
And on the horse they wrote "Minerva of Greece gives a gift," and carried it over to the military base in Tenedo. 
When the Trojans saw it, the enemies were judged to go away; Priamus ordered the horse to be led by Minerva to the temple. 
When the prophet, Cassandra, dedicated the enemies to have the horse, faith was not given to it and the horse was placed on behalf of the church.
The Greeks went out of the gate when the guard fell down and Troy was conquered.
