C. Translation

Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Chaos was the first of the gods. His daughters were Nox, the mother of all man, and Terra, the goddess Earth. **(Since "māter omnium hominum" is right next to Terra, it certainly describes her, not Nox.)** This mother  was the god of death and destruction. **(Take "haec" as the subject and "mater" as the predicate and those genitives will make sense.)** His sons were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes. Typhon and Python were horrible dragons, and Cyclopes was a foolish mason. **("Cyclopes" is actually plural from Cyclops, Cyclopis, masculine.  That should help make the form "fabri bruti" make sense!)** But his brother, Uranus, was the first king of the gods. He was strong and large **(or "great")**, but wise.
